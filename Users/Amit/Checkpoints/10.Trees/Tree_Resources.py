# I need to understand working with trees in a comprehensive manner. With so many resources available on the internet it becomes confusing whether the subject is finished or it has more gems to explore. 
# 
# This document is a collection of resources that would help build a thourough understanding of trees as a data structure.
# 
# Resource 1: Basic algorithms on Trees to understand the trees ecosystem in computer science. From any standard book. For me it's "Data Structure and Algorithmic Thinking with Python by Narsimha Karumanchi".

# Resource 2: [Geeks for Geeks](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/category/tree/)
