    "B-Trees are useful when the data doesn't fit in memory. B-Trees is a data structure that minimizes I/O operations. Let's see how B-Trees does it. Many database systems use B-Trees of variant of B-Trees to store information.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "We store keys in B-Trees. We also store pointers to the actual data pages besides the key. For this discussion we are going to assume that the data is the keys stored in a node of a B-Tree. A non empty B-Tree has at least 1 key in the root.\n",
    "\n",
    "If T is the B-Tree then T.root is it's root. Let's assume that x is one of the nodes in the B-Tree:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. x.n is the number of keys stored in node x\n",
    "2. $x.key_1$, $x.key_2$, $x.key_3$, ..., $x.key_{x.n}$ are the keys stored in node x\n",
    "3. x.leaf is a boolean that tells whether x is a leaf.\n",
    "4. x also contains (x.n+1) pointers to it's children say $x.c_1$, $x.c_2$, ...., $x.c_{x.n+1}$\n",
    "4. All leaves have the same depth, which is the height of the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the exception of the root any node x has minimum t-1 keys or maximum 2t-1 keys where t is the degree of the B-Tree and t>=2. t is called the **minimum degree** of the B-Tree and the lower and upper bound on the number of keys that can be stored in a B-Tree is mentioned in terms of t.\n",
    "\n",
    "**We say a node x is full when it exactly has 2t-1 keys**\n",

    "1. Because the minimum number of keys in any node besides the root is 2, and by definition minimum number of keys is t-1. Hence t-1 = 2 this implies t >= 3. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Maximum can't be determined without disambiguity, or can it? If we say maximum number of keys is 3 then (2t-1) = 3, this implies, t=2, which is wrong because we have seen above that t>=3, hence we can have maximum of 5 keys in the B Tree shown in Figure 18.1\n",
