### Why GooglePedia.

This is a book written by inspiring Googlers for fellow inspiring Googlers. The idea is to have a clear understanding of concepts following "Feynman's principles's". So, once you have covered this book end-to-end one can be sure of cracking the Big-4 Interview.

What is the **Big-4**?

By Big-4 I mean the top 4 IT companies which are supposed to have the toughest technical interviews.

 1. Google
 2. Facebook
 3. Microsoft
 4. Amazon

Definetely, there are a lot of other cool companies out there but the idea is once we are prepared for these 4 companies we are well prepared to crack any other biggie out there.


### What will GooglePedia cover?

As we all know the most important part of any Google interview is **"Data Structures and Algorithms"**.
And, yes that's what we will cover here in much simpler, understandable and fun way.
