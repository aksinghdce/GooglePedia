Introduction To Algorithms
=======

Algorithms are everywhere, whether you are :

 - Writing a software
 - Analysing a genome
 - Predicting Traffic Jams
 - Automating movie recommendations
 - Or, simple surfing the Internet

It's important the algorithms we use are efficient, a poorly thought out algorithm can take centuries to process at times.

That's why tech companies ask a lot of algorithmic question in interviews.

In data science problems like ranking internet search results, predicting road accidents, recommending movie to users , advanced algorithms are used.

For a simple Machine learning algorithm like linear regression to process Big Data is a challenge. When advanced algorithms like Deep neural networks are applied to big data sets they  provide accurate recommendations sometimes even outperform humans.

Algorithms are everywhere, all the trillion cells in our body execute complex and still poorly understood algorithms. Algorithm is the key to understand important medical conditions like mutation.

Implement algorithms to apply them to solve practical problems such as assembling the genome from millions of tiny fragments is the largest jigsaw puzzle ever assembled by humans.

**Purpose of the Book :**

The purpose of this book is to learn how to be a pro in implementing algorithms solving a computational problem in minimum possible time even on large datasets.

Every problem we approach will be solved using the below steps -

 1. Understanding the Problem.
 2. Writing a Pseudo code (White board programming practice).
 3. Implementing the Code(mostly in Python but later solutions in java and Javascript will also be available)
 4. Asymptotic analysis of the solution.
 5. Test cases for the code.
 6. Challenges and discussions.
